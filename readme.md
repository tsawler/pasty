# Pasty

Pasty is a wrapper which makes working with Paseto tokens as simple as possible. 
[Paseto](https://github.com/paragonie/paseto) (Platform-Agnostic SEcurity TOkens) is 
a specification for secure stateless tokens.

This module uses [go-paseto](https://github.com/aidantwoods/go-paseto) to generate and
validate tokens.
